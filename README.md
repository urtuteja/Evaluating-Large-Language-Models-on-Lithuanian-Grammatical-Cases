# Evaluating-Large-Language-Models-on-Lithuanian-Grammatical-Cases

This repository accompanies the paper *Evaluating Large Language Models on Lithuanian Grammatical Cases*.  
It contains the **Use_of_Cases** dataset, provided in both CSV and Excel formats. For items involving specific verbs, those verbs are listed in the `problem_source` column.

In addition, the repository includes the script used for the experiments: `evaluate_pairs.py`.
